# **HorizonStore E-Commerce**  
  

I have built this project for understanding the concepts of RxJS and E-Commerce.
  
  

**I used**  
  

- Plain CSS and React.js for UI  
  

- RxJS for manipulating the data of user's events  


- Webpack for bundling  
  

- Babel for compiling javascript compatible for older browsers
